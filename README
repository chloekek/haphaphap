First, run the database setup script:

    nix-build -A scripts && result/bin/setup-database.bash

After it has created the database cluster,
the script will wait until postgresql is running.
Open a new terminal and run the following command
to start all the services including postgresql:

    nix-build -A ops.hivemind && result/bin/hivemind --root . result/etc/Procfile

Now the database setup script will finish
and you can close its terminal.

Now your development environment is up and running.
You can access haphaphap at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

While the development environment is running,
you can run the tests with the following command:

    nix-build -A tests && result/bin/prove
